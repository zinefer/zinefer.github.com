These Stackable assortment bins were inspired by [Alexandre Chappel's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHFK5sY8ToE) design as well as a [thingiverse remix](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4681582). The thingiverse remix did not behave when changing parameters around so I reworked it from scratch.
