This stand holds 50ml cartridge for a mixing gun upright while filling. There is a ledge that catches a lip on the cartridge to provide a foot that gives a lot of confidence when lowering into your vacuum chamber. It requires very little support to print.

## Mixing Gun

I find these mixing guns really convenient and great for "injecting" material into molds. If these mixing guns are new to you and you'd like to try them here are some links:

You should be careful, it seems there are to styles of mixing tips and cartridges and they are incompatible with each other but both work with the gun.
