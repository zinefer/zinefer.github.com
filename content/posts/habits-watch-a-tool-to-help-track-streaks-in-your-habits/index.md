I have been monitoring my Habits lately and trying to maximize momentum in areas that I care about. This practice is somtimes called no-zero-days or streak tracking. People in many professions practice it from makers like Simone Giertz to comedians like Jerry Seinfeld.

I like the look of the github contributions chart and have decided to create a service that can help you track anything you like in the same style.

I have opensourced this project on [github](https://github.com/zinefer/habits). You can try it for yourself at http://habits.watch
