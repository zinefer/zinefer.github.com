For the past few years I have had the opportunity to hide easter egg games into the SparkFun homepage. Today I created a github repository and open-sourced all of those games. You can play them [here](http://sparkfun.github.io/Dino_Eggs/) or look at the source [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/Dino_Eggs)
