Artist and Maker, Ryan Kramer reached out to me to help create his wall art dedicated to the brand new [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/).

The base was cut from 1/2" MDF, spray painted black, with some 1mm acrylic gold mirror inlays. The corners on the mirrors are perfectly sharp so Ryan cut each round over in the corners of each of the the hex pockets with a chisel to get an incredible fit.

We've decided to open source this design but if you would like to support our collaboration please feel free to donate what you feel comfortable to Ryan's charity fund.

The fusion 360 file is fairly parametric and you should be able to customize it to almost any size.
