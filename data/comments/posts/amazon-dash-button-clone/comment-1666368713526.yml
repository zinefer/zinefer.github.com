  This is really cool! I just started looking at DIY dash buttons to use in a
  big warehouse. There is already Wifi so Zigbee isn't better in our case. Did
  you ever get any of these boards made?  Curious how long the battery lasts.
  I've seen other designs which also have a relay to cut power to the ESP
  completely to save even more power.
