body: "I'm not sure if this is of any interest, but the original openssl package is still installed on the Pi. It's version 1.0.1. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ /usr/bin/openssl version\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1t  3 May 2016\r\n$ /usr/local/bin/openssl version\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.2o  27 Mar 2018\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to get rid of the old one and replace it with the new, but the old one is installed / managed by apt-get. Is it safe to just copy my built one on top of it? But then, how do I know what needs copying?"
