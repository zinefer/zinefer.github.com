  My OrangePi A64 win+ computer is still processing.... it would not allow me to
  upgrade python from 3.5.2 and I need 3.6 or better to run numpy and
  matplotlib. I hope this works cuz nothing else will/would so far. I need  to
  plot pressure readings from 4 BMP280 chips attached to a 4 cylinder motorcycle
  engines for tuning. I'm gonna make a nice box for the processor and
  multiplexer. 3D printed the BMP280 chip housings which attach to the carbs. I
  have a working prototype using a RPi 4. Uses ic2 and a multiplexer. Using
  python to plot the pressures for each cylinder in sequence as I manually tune
  the carbs. Many thanks for your efforts regarding the software. Great to know
  some decent people still exist. I'll let you know if it worked out for me.
  Otherwise I'll junk the orange Pi and get another RPi 4. I had the Orange Pi
  sitting in a drawer for 4 years doing nothing, bought it for $35, A RPi 4 cost
  over $150 now. So that's why I thought i'd try and use it.
