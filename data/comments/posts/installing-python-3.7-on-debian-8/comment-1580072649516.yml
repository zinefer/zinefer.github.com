body: "Hi!\r\nhad some trouble with the OpenSSL bit attempting a Python 3.7.6 install.\r\n\r\nI used OpenSSL 1.1.0l, so i just changed the so.1.0 files to so.1.1, and before running make on python, i had to run ldconfig so /usr/local/bin/openssl would run properly.\r\nalso had to run the python ./configure without the --enable-optimizations switch.\r\n\r\ni also  had an issue with _ctypes module, quicly solved by running apt-get install libffi-dev."
