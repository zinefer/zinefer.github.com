  You could mill out a bit of Skylab to hang on a wall. On the 42nd page of this
  PDF are the dimensions for the isogrid panels in the Skylab space station.
  https://femci.gsfc.nasa.gov/isogrid/NASA-CR-124075_Isogrid_Design.pdf Nobody
  has been able to find an original copy so we must make do with what looks like
  it was run through FAX and photocopy (before photocopiers could do shades of
  grey) then one of those Nth gen copies was photographed for microfiche then
  that was digitized for the PDF.
