body: "Thank you! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately this specific cabinet did not get finished. The majority of the cabinets frame was finished and we were working on getting slots routed for the T molding. We ran out of time while I was back home and I have heard that the place that the sides were being stored in were flooded and they warped.\r\n\r\nDon't worry though! When the CNC is finished getting moved this will be one of the first projects I revisit and it will be so much easier than getting those angles and curves right on a table saw like last time."
