body: "Heads up: it looks like they changed the syntax for the CleanWebpackPlugin. I was getting \"TypeError: CleanWebpackPlugin is not a constructor\" on build, resolved by changing a couple lines, as noted in this SO thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56567930/typeerror-cleanwebpackplugin-is-not-a-constructor\r\n\r\nThanks for this quick setup guide. It can be hard to find good, minimal boilerplate when starting new projects too try out technologies."
