body: "Thanks! I've found some more edge cases. I'll try to fix them and will update you a bit later. For now these are:\r\n1. When model is joined using a single form: `joins(:state)` it will not match against klass.pluralize.to_sym\r\n2. When join is done using syntax of `joins(model1: :model2)` it should unwrap the hash from `joins_values`\r\n\r\nP.S. I believe this is a valuable snippet we should polish so you can post it all over stackoverflow :)"
