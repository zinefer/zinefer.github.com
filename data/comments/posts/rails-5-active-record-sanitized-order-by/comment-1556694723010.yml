body: "Hi James, thanks for sharing :)\r\nOne question though â€” what if I have the model name stated in the order clause directly, is there a way to check no only `joins_values`, but kind-of `from-values`? Couldn't find a method for that :(\r\n```\r\n scope :ordered_by_city, ->(order) {sanitized_order(\"addresses.city\", order)}\r\n\r\nAddress.ordered_by_city('ASC')\r\n->> RuntimeError (addresses unavailable in query)\r\n```"
